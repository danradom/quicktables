redhat users should use the install.sh-redhat file to install
quicktables.  running that installation script copies the rc.firewall to
/usr/local/sbin, copies the init script to /etc/rc.d/init.d, and tells
redhat to start quicktables when the system boots up.

to run the install script simply type ./install.sh-redhat from within
the contrib/redhat directory.

the init script also lets you use the "service" command to start and
restart quicktables.  it also supports two different status views
using the status and status_nat commands.  to see all the options simply
run ...

	/sbin/service quicktables

to manually install quicktables issue the following commands ...

	cp rc.firewall /usr/local/sbin
	chown root /usr/local/sbin/rc.firewall
	chmod 744 /usr/local/sbin/rc.firewall

you will then need to add "/usr/local/sbin/rc.firewall" to rc.local.
the location and existance of rc.local vary from distribution to
distribution.  you can try issuing the following command to find
rc.local ...

	find / -name rc.local -print

once you find the file simply add "/usr/local/sbin/rc.firewall" to the
very bottom of it.
